## Reflection on Work Integrated Learning (STAR Technique)

### Situation
During my Work Integrated Learning period, I was placed at **PLUM Systems** as a **Junior Developer** within a development team working on projects for **API Property Group**. The work environment was professional and industry-driven, requiring adherence to client specifications, internal development processes, and accurate time tracking through the Odoo ERP system.

### Task
My primary responsibilities included assisting with frontend user interface development, participating in daily team meetings, learning and applying React concepts, testing mobile applications using Android Studio, and accurately logging all development activities on the company’s ERP system. I was also tasked with transforming design concepts into functional and visually consistent user interfaces aligned with API Property Group’s branding requirements.

### Action
To complete my tasks effectively, I actively collaborated with team members during daily stand-up meetings and followed guidance from senior developers and team leads. I worked on enhancing a client registration page by applying the correct colour schemes, layout structure, and input field styling to meet branding standards. I used Android Studio and an emulator to test UI functionality and responsiveness on mobile devices. Additionally, I consistently logged my work activities, meeting participation, and development tasks on the Odoo ERP platform to ensure accountability and accurate project tracking.

### Result
As a result of my actions, I gained hands-on experience in real-world software development within a professional environment. I improved my technical skills in frontend development and mobile application testing, developed a stronger understanding of workplace collaboration, and learned the importance of accurate documentation and time management. This WIL experience prepared me for industry expectations and strengthened my confidence in contributing meaningfully to development projects.
