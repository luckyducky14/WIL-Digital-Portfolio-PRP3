The image above shows a registration page developed for new API Property Group clients. During my Work Integrated Learning at PLUM Systems, I was responsible for transforming an initial blank black-and-white registration layout into a fully branded API Property Group registration page. This involved applying the correct colour scheme, layout structure, and input field styling to align with the client’s design requirements.

This image demonstrates the development environment used during the project, including Android Studio and an Android emulator. I used this setup to run and test the mobile application, verify UI changes, and ensure that the registration functionality worked correctly on mobile devices.

## Odoo ERP Timesheet Activities – PLUM Systems

The image above shows my logged timesheet activities on the PLUM Systems Odoo ERP platform. This system is used internally to track employee work hours, project allocation, and task descriptions.

The screenshot reflects my authenticated user profile, **Luvo Nana**, with multiple dated entries where I recorded daily development activities, including:
- Daily meetings with the development team
- Learning and implementing React
- Working on and resolving software issues
- Project-related tasks linked to API Property Group

Each timesheet entry includes the date, a description of the work performed, the associated analytic account (project), and the duration of time spent. This artefact serves as verified evidence of my active participation in development work and confirms my placement at PLUM Systems during my Work Integrated Learning period.
