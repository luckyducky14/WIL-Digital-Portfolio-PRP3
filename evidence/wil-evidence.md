## Registration Page UI Development – API Property Group

![API Property Group Registration Screen](api-registration-screen.jpg)

The image above shows a registration page developed for new API Property Group clients. During my Work Integrated Learning at PLUM Systems, I was responsible for transforming an initial blank black-and-white registration layout into a fully branded API Property Group registration page. This involved applying the correct colour scheme, layout structure, and input field styling to align with the client’s design requirements.

## Mobile Application Development Environment

This image demonstrates the development environment used during the project, including Android Studio and an Android emulator. I used this setup to run and test the mobile application, verify UI changes, and ensure that the registration functionality worked correctly on mobile devices.
