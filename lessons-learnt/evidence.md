## Development Environment Evidence – Mobile Application Testing

The image above shows the development environment used during my Work Integrated Learning at **PLUM Systems**. It illustrates **Visual Studio Code** being used as the primary code editor alongside **Android Studio** with an active Android emulator.

Visual Studio Code was used to write, modify, and manage the mobile application’s source code, including configuring dependencies and running development scripts. Android Studio was used to launch and control the Android emulator, allowing the application to be executed and tested in a simulated mobile device environment.

This setup enabled me to run the application directly from Visual Studio Code and observe the results in real time on the Android emulator. It also allowed me to monitor console logs, warnings, and runtime messages, which assisted in identifying configuration issues and verifying that user interface changes were correctly applied. This evidence demonstrates practical exposure to industry-standard mobile application development and testing tools.

Through this task, I learnt the importance of following structured deployment procedures in a real-world development environment. Rebasing with the production branch helped me understand how version control is used to keep code aligned and avoid conflicts.

I also learnt that maintaining consistent dependency versions, such as ensuring `react` and `react-dom` are set to the same version, is essential to prevent build and runtime errors. This reinforced the need to always verify project configurations before deployment.

Additionally, I gained practical experience using Yarn and Firebase to build and deploy a test version of an application. Deploying to a temporary testing channel highlighted the value of internal testing before releasing changes to production.

Lastly, I learnt that effective communication is a key part of software development. Sharing test links, updating issue labels, and tagging team members ensured smooth collaboration and efficient testing workflows.
