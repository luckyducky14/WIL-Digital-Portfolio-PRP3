## Lessons Learnt (STAR Technique)

### Situation
During my Work Integrated Learning at **PLUM Systems**, I worked on both web and mobile application components for **API Property Group**. The development process required me to use multiple tools and workflows, including Visual Studio Code, Android Studio with an emulator, Git version control, and Firebase hosting for testing purposes. These tasks needed to be completed accurately to ensure functionality before production deployment.

### Task
I was responsible for running and testing the mobile application in a development environment, applying UI changes, and ensuring that the application functioned correctly on an Android emulator. In addition, I was required to prepare a test version of the application by rebasing my code with the production branch, managing dependencies, building the project, and deploying it to a temporary Firebase hosting channel for internal testing.

### Action
I used Visual Studio Code to write and modify source code, manage dependencies, and run development scripts. I connected this workflow to Android Studio, where I launched and tested the application on an Android emulator to verify UI behaviour and functionality.  
For deployment, I rebased my branch with `origin/Prod`, resolved merge conflicts, verified that critical dependencies such as `react` and `react-dom` were correctly set to version 18.2.0, and prepared the code by commenting out specified imports. I then ran the required Yarn build commands and deployed the application using Firebase. Once deployment was successful, I shared the generated test link with the team and updated the issue status accordingly.

### Result
Through this process, the application was successfully tested and deployed to a non-production environment, enabling internal testing without impacting live systems. I gained a deeper understanding of end-to-end development workflows, including local development, mobile testing, version control, dependency management, and deployment processes. This experience improved my problem-solving skills, technical confidence, and awareness of professional development standards used in industry.
